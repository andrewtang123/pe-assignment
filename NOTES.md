# Notes


I implemented DiscountX classes for
- Buy one, get one free
- Buy one kilo of vegetables for half price

The other discounts can be done using similar pattern
- Buy two items for £1
- Buy three items for the price of two

Should not need to instantiate the DiscountX classes above - should be changed to have static methods
